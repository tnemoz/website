I am a third-year engineering student at <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home">Télécom Paris</a>. I've done my second year in engineering at <a href="https://eurecom.fr/en">Eurecom</a> where I've studied Cybersecurity and Machine Learning. I've pursued my studies at the <a href="https://imperial.ac.uk">Imperial College London</a> where I've studied Cybersecurity, Quantum Computing, Machine Learning and Blockchain-related topics.

<br />

I intend to do a PhD in Quantum Computing, either applied to Cryptography or Machine Learning. If you see or have an offer in that topic, please <a href="mailto:tristan@tnemoz.fr">let me know</a> :).

<br />

During my spare time, I either hang out with friends, or code something that I find cool, like personal research or CTF challenges, like <a href="https://www.root-me.org/g2i?lang=en">Root-me</a> ones.
